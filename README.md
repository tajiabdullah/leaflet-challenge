# Leaflet Challenge

## Visualizing Data with Leaflet

The United States Geological Survey (USGS) is responsible for providing scientific data about natural hazards, the health of our ecosystems and environment; and the impacts of climate and land-use change. The USGS’ scientists develop new methods and tools to supply timely, relevant, and useful information about the Earth and its processes. For this particular project, I utilized USGS’ earthquake data to create visualization. 

### Steps

1. Retrieved dataset from the USGS’ website, which is as follows: http://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/feed/v1.0/geojson.php.  More specifically, I used the dataset titled: "All Earthquakes from the Past 7 Days".

2. Created a map using Leaflet that plots all of the earthquakes from your data set based on their longitude and latitude, which included data markers that reflected each earthquake’s magnitude by size and each earthquakes’ depth by color. 

3. Included popups that provides additional information about the earthquake upon clicking the marker.

4. Created a legend that provides context for the map’s data.

Upon completing the aforementioned steps, my visualization was as follows.
